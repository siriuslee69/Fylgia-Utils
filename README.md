# SiriusUtils

This repo is meant to be a collection of some code I often use and want to have access to.

## Layout

Each proc has its tests written right below them. 
They can be called with "nim c -d:test -r filename.nim".

The test_all.nim file can be run without the "-d:test" flag and will run all tests. 
Just do "nim c -r test_all.nim".

## Warning

Use at your own risk. Subject to change.
